//When we annotate a field with @Lob, JPA will store the attribute in a database-supported large object type, such as BLOB (Binary Large Object) or CLOB (Character Large Object), depending on the type of data being stored.

//The @Column annotation with columnDefinition = "LONGBLOB" specifies the SQL column definition for image_data. In SQL databases like MySQL, LONGBLOB is a type that can hold large binary data, suitable for storing images and other large objects.
